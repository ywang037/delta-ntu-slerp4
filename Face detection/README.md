## General information

This folder collects information and tutorials from internet that introduce how to do face detection, using the [dlib](http://dlib.net/python/index.html) or [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). 

The project [OpenFace](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) introduce how they implement the entire pipline with FaceNet.

The blog [Building a Facial Recognition Pipeline with Deep Learning in Tensorflow](https://hackernoon.com/building-a-facial-recognition-pipeline-with-deep-learning-in-tensorflow-66e7645015b8) also uses dlib.

This page [Real-time facial landmark detection with OpenCV, Python, and dlib](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/17/real-time-facial-landmark-detection-opencv-python-dlib/) and other related articles e.g., [How to install dlib](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/) on the same websites (just use search bar with keyword dlib or opencv) are good tutorials to kick off.
