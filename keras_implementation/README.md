In this directory, we implement 1.0-MobileNet-224, Inception-v3, and VGG-16 using Keras python deep learning function APIs. Our objective is to test the processing time from an image is loaded and the feature is extracted from the correspoding CNN. 

The documents of keras can be found [here](https://keras.io/), where the details of installation and examples are provided. To use keras, one need to first install the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), for example [installing with the Anaconda](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#installing_with_anaconda). Installing Keras with anaconda can be found [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/keras) using ubantu command line.

There is a tutorial shows how to implement a cnn from scratch:
